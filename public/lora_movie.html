 <h1>The Best Movie According to Lora</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <p>Honestly, it's really hard to pick top 3 movies because I forgot a lot of movies that I have already watched. But these are the 3 that comes to mind everytime i got asked "what's your favorite movie?" </p>
 <hr/>
 <h3>The Help</h3>
 <p>Do I even have to explain why? The story is amazing. I cried, I laughed, I was angry, all emotions into one. <br /><br />
    P.S. I might actually re-watch it for the third time this week.</p>
<h3>Hachiko</h3>
<p>This movie left a mark in my heart but definitely not something I'd want to rewatch. My heart is still hurting from watching this as a kid. (I am 26 y.o)</p>
<h3>27 Dresses</h3>
<p>If I were to give you one rom-com then it would be this. I love Katherine Heigl. (I also love Izzie)</p>
<hr>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I can only guarantee the first two on the list as my actual favorite movies. The third place goes to 27 dresses because that's the only rom-com movies that I could recall T.T.<br />
Ok bye</p>
